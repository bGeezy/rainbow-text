## Rainbow text algorithm

The goal will be to implement a function that takes an arbitrary string as input, and outputs that string colorized (with HTML) in a rainbow pattern.

### Guidelines

1. The color pattern will be ROYGBIV (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet).
2. Input is a string of arbitrary length.
3. The output string should be an HTML string of rainbow text.
4. The rainbox text should repeat if the text is longer than 7 characters.

**Next**, modify the function such that the rainbow stretches across the length of the string.
